# **Chinese hitman Li Zhao Yu is a radiant with the ability to transmute ambient, intangible radianite energy into solid, durable constructs. While working for a secret organization, Li gained a fearsome reputation as a highly effective assassin. Though it was said that anyone who would go up against him would disappear for good, rumors still spread beyond about the "Dead Lilac", a bulletproof wizard who could take out entire squads with one round and condemn targets to their fate in a flash of purple.**

# **Li had been crossing off targets related to Kingdom Corporation's Project Landfall when one day his employer changed focus and gave him a new target: an ex-employee of theirs now known as Omen. The organization Omen now worked for, the VALORANT Protocol, had meanwhile put themselves in a position where Li would become of interest to them anyway. They had attacked a Landfall facility just before Li's latest assignment, and they were now investigating the unrelated disappearance of Landfall's leadership, people Li had been assassinating. When a contact from the Protocol reached out, Li was willing to join them and cooperate so long as he had protection against his employer.**

# **Iso wears an overall white-colored hoodie, with dark purple colors reaching to his collar, along with some markings at the back, as well as a pair of purple-colored sneakers with red laces, white midsoles and black outsoles. He has black hair, and what appears to be a bandage on his right cheek, and has earbuds in his ears.**
