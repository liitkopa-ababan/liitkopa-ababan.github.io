**Chinese hitman Li Zhao Yu is a radiant with the ability to transmute ambient, intangible radianite energy into solid, durable constructs. While working for a secret organization, Li gained a fearsome reputation as a highly effective assassin. Though it was said that anyone who would go up against him would disappear for good, rumors still spread beyond about the "Dead Lilac", a bulletproof wizard who could take out entire squads with one round and condemn targets to their fate in a flash of purple.**

**Li had been crossing off targets related to Kingdom Corporation's Project Landfall when one day his employer changed focus and gave him a new target: an ex-employee of theirs now known as Omen. The organization Omen now worked for, the VALORANT Protocol, had meanwhile put themselves in a position where Li would become of interest to them anyway. They had attacked a Landfall facility just before Li's latest assignment, and they were now investigating the unrelated disappearance of Landfall's leadership, people Li had been assassinating. When a contact from the Protocol reached out, Li was willing to join them and cooperate so long as he had protection against his employer.**

**Li has now arrived at VALORANT as its twenty-fourth recruit, "Iso", but much around him still remains a mystery. He's been unable to provide a lot of information about his former employer, not even so much as their name, claiming that they kept much of their operations compartmentalized. Meanwhile, Omen himself has taken a strong interest in Iso, desperate to uncover the mysteries of his own forgotten past after learning that Iso comes from the same organization that he used to work for. The VALORANT Protocol has made risky hires in the past, but with so much about Iso still veiled in secrecy, he might just be their biggest gamble yet.**


**Iso wears an overall white-colored hoodie, with dark purple colors reaching to his collar, along with some markings at the back, as well as a pair of purple-colored sneakers with red laces, white midsoles and black outsoles. He has black hair, and what appears to be a bandage on his right cheek, and has earbuds in his ears.**
